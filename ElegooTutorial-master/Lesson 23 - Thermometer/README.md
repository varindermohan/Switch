Thermistor MF52 A 103 F 3950.  Demonstrate an inspired Elegoo sketch provided in the tutorial covering the Thermistor, using it as a thermometer.  A beginner's guide to the Most Complete Starter Kit by Elegoo.

Hello everyone, I'm Rick the Tech Enthusiast here with the next Elegoo Lesson.  This is the next lesson on my Arduino UNO Series covering the Most Complete Starter Kit by Elegoo.   I try to follow the included tutorial and will point out any changes or corrections as I find them.

As mentioned before, I purchased this Elegoo starter kit and Elegoo isn't sponsoring me.  I just thought it would be fun to do a video of each Lesson as I was learning the Arduino environment. 

We’ll need a few things from your Elegoo Arduino UNO kit.  I’ll list the items below.  In this lesson we’re going to check out an NTC Thermistor, a resistive device that changes with temperature.  I’ll step through an Elegoo inspired tutorial, briefly explain the code, and build and configure a simple circuit that is to demonstrate the functionality.  I hope you enjoy it. 

## Parts you’ll need for the tutorial

* Elegoo Uno R3 board
* 1602A LCD module
* Thermistor
* 10K Potentiometer
* 10K-ohm resistor
* 220-ohm resistor
* A bunch of jumper wires.

The next lesson will be Lesson 24: Eight LED with 74HC595
