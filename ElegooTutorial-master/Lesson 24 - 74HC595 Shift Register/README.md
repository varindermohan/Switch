Eight LED with 74HC595, or 74HC595 shift register.  Demonstrate the tutorial’s sketch and expand the sketch to show back to back shift registers.  A beginner's guide to the Most Complete Starter Kit by Elegoo.

Hello everyone, I'm Rick the Tech Enthusiast here with the next Elegoo Lesson.  This is the next lesson on my Arduino UNO Series covering the Most Complete Starter Kit by Elegoo.   I try to follow the included tutorial and will point out any changes or corrections as I find them.

As mentioned before, I purchased this Elegoo starter kit and Elegoo isn't sponsoring me.  I just thought it would be fun to do a video of each Lesson as I was learning the Arduino environment. 

We’ll need a few things from your Elegoo Arduino UNO kit.  I’ll list the items below.  In this lesson we’re going to check out the 74HC595 shift register, a digital output port expanding device that uses only three Arduino outputs.  I’ll step through the Elegoo tutorial, briefly explain the code, and build and configure a simple circuit that is to demonstrate the functionality.  Then I’ll expand the circuit with back to back shift registers to control 16 outputs.  I hope you enjoy it. 

## Parts you’ll need for the tutorial

* Elegoo Uno R3 board
* 74HC595 shift register IC
* 8 LEDS, 2 blue, 2 yellow, 2 red, and 2 green
* 8 220-ohm resistors
* The breadboard 
* A bunch of male-to-male jumper wires (about 13 or so).
The expanded circuit requires an additional 74HC595 shift register and additional 220-ohm resisters purchased separately.

The next lesson will be Lesson 25:  The Serial Monitor
