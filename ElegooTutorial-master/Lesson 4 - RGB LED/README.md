A beginner's guide to the Most Complete Starter Kit by Elegoo.  Lesson 4 – RGB LED

Hello everyone, I'm Rick the Tech Enthusiast again, with the next Lesson number 4 “RGB LED”.  This is the next lesson on my Arduino UNO Series covering the Most Complete Starter Kit by Elegoo.   Now, I try to follow the tutorial closely, without overburdening the viewer with every detail, but I will point out any changes or corrections as I find them.

As mentioned before, I recently purchased this Arduino UNO R3 kit by Elegoo.  I’m pronouncing it El-E-Goo, I hope that’s right.  No, Elegoo isn't sponsoring me.  I just thought it would be fun to do a video of each Lesson as I was learning the Arduino environment. 

In this video, we’ll need a few things from your Elegoo Arduino kit.  I’ll list the items below.  In this lesson we’re going to learn how to change the colors of the RGB LED with the Arduino using PWM (pulse width modulation).  I step through the Elegoo code to explain how it makes this happen.  Then I expand on the idea with a revised sketch.  The new sketch has three different methods of making colors with the RGB LED. The first method was inspired by HowToMechatronic.com.  By using a function call we greatly simplify the code and make everything more readable.  Next, I rewrite the three “for loops” that was included in the original code.  And third, I create a single “do loop” or “do while loop” to cycle through all the colors in a single loop.  Best of all, I’ve added Serial.begin and Serial.print statements to view and diagnose the code in the Serial Monitor.  I hope you like the Lesson, it was a lot of fun to make.

## Parts you’ll need

* Arduino UNO R3 board
* RGB LED (the only LED in the kit with four leads)
* Three 220 ohm resistors
* Four male-to-male wire jumpers
* Breadboard

I should also mention that ** Paul McWhorter ** has a great [programming series for the Arduino UNO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8_xXNcGYgo&list=PLGs0VKk2DiYx6CMdOQR_hmJ2NbB4mZQn-).  You should check it out.
 
The next lesson will be Lesson 5 – Digital Inputs
