Hello everyone, I'm Rick the Tech Enthusiast again, with the next Lesson number 5 “Digital Inputs”.  This is the next lesson on my Arduino UNO Series covering the Most Complete Starter Kit by Elegoo.   I try to follow the tutorial closely, without overburdening the viewer with every detail, but I will point out any changes or corrections as I find them.

As mentioned before, I purchased this Elegoo starter kit.  I’m pronouncing it El-E-Goo, I hope that’s right (I sometimes slip and say El-a-Goo).  No, Elegoo isn't sponsoring me.  I just thought it would be fun to do a video of each Lesson as I was learning the Arduino environment. 

For this video, we’ll need a few things from your Elegoo Arduino kit.  I’ll list the items below.  In this lesson we’re going to learn how to include digital inputs to your circuit using a couple of pushbutton switches.  I step through the Elegoo provided code to explain how it makes this happen.  Then, like before, I expand on the idea with a revised sketch.  I wanted to provide a sketch that only uses a single button to turn on and off the LED.  I also introduce the idea of debouncing the button input and how to handle it with code.  And there more.  I include yet another sketch, and this time it’s a circuit that turns on, and automatically goes to sleep when done.  The watchdog timer is included to periodically wake the board.  And a manual method in included to wake the circuit using a button and assigning to an Arduino interrupt.  All while trying to achieve a very low power, deep sleep, mode.  I got some great ideas from Kevin Darrah and Lynda.com

Of course, I’ve added Serial.begin and Serial.print statements to view and diagnose the code in the Serial Monitor.  I hope you like the Lesson, it was a lot of fun to make.

## Parts you’ll need for the basic tutorial

* Arduino UNO R3 board
* 5mm LED
* 220 ohm resistor
* Two pushbutton switches
* Seven male-to-male wire jumpers
* And the breadboard

I should also mention that **Kevin Darrah** has a great [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urLSDi7SD8M) for the low power, deep sleep mode for the Arduino UNO.  You should check it out.

The next lesson will be Lesson 6 – Active Buzzer
